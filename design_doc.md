# Cube League Site Design Document

This is a document intended to answer some basic questions about the ICT Cube League website in order to allow rapid design and development.

## 1. Goal Identification

### Who is the site for?
* Myself, as curator and organizer of the Cube League
* Participants in the cube league
* Those curious about the cube league
* Those curious about the cube format

### What do they expect to find or do there?
* See standings for this and all previous seasons
* Generate sample packs from cube list
* View the entire list
* View a visual spoiler of the list
* Read about the cube
* Read about the cube league

### Is this website's primary aim to inform, to sell, or to amuse?
* To inform: Learn about when and where the Cube League is held
* To sell: To advocate that magic players in Wichita come to the cube league
* To amuse: Generating sample packs and speculating about first picks is fun!
* To inform: To learn about the cube format more generally
* To sell: A demonstration of my web development skills.

### Does the website need to clearly convey a brand's core message, or is it part fo a wider branding strategy with its own unique focus?
* There is not a Cube League brand, but ICT Cube League could definitely establish a brand. Would be cool to have a logo.

### What competitor sites, if any, exist, and how should this site be inspired by or different from those competitors?
* I don't see any site as the competitor. This is a personal project site.
* However, cubetutor.com already implements a lot of the features I wish to implement on my own site.
* I would like to develop my site without looking at Ben Titmarsh's implementation of those features.
